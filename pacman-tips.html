            <h2>Here are a few tips and strategies to make you a better player</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
            <p>Pacman might feel like a simple game, but
                it’s actually very intense and challenging. It’s the type of title that will
                always catch you off-guard just because every board is different. But with the
                right Pacman strategy and with a healthy dose of experimentation you can get
                amazing results. In the end it’s all about being committed and having fun.</p>



            <p><strong>Track
                    the ghosts</strong></p>



            <p>Since they are coming to get you, it’s
                important to stay away from them. It works in everything from the Pacman
                original to the Pacman online and many others. The trick is that you want to
                track the ghosts as fast as possible and stay away from them. If they come too
                close to you, then there are some methods to get rid of them. There are only 4
                ghosts, so managing them is a lot easier.</p>



            <p><strong>Get
                    all the points by going in a continuous line</strong></p>



            <p>Shifting all around might work in the Pacman
                online game, but that will increase the time you need. Which is why the best
                trick you can have is to go in a straight line as much as possible. Sure, when
                the ghosts are on you it might be hard to do it. But when you have the chance,
                do that. The idea is to acquire as many points as you can for the best results.
            </p>



            <p><strong>Use
                    the sides</strong></p>



            <p>You can go from the left side to the right
                if you want. It might not feel that important, but it does work well and the
                nice thing is that you can always commit to whatever idea and strategy you
                want. All of that can be really rewarding, as long as you know how to manage
                and handle everything in a meaningful way.</p>



            <p><strong>Try
                    various patterns</strong></p>



            <p>The trick is to see a pattern that works
                and use it based on the level. Some people used the cherry pattern in the Pacman
                original and it worked well for them. Others go with the apple pattern, as
                that’s very helpful too. Don’t hesitate to experiment with patterns and even
                create your own if you want.</p>



            <p><strong>Use
                    trick zones</strong></p>



            <p>These are at the upper right or bottom
                right as well as the tunnels. You can use these with the idea of misguiding the
                ghosts. Of course, as soon as you used the ghosts you want to get to the
                desired location as fast as possible. Because if you’re not able to do that, you
                will most likely lose.</p>



            <p>The idea with Pacman online is that you
                always need to evade and come up with a great Pacman strategy. Every time you
                play you can try out something new and interesting, it all comes down to not
                having a stale approach. It’s a great opportunity for players and it will work
                pretty well. Yes, it’s not the simplest option, but as long as you strive to
                come up with new ideas it might help quite a bit. Yet you have to realize that
                Pacman is a game about experimenting and trying new things. So that should be a
                great motivator as you play!</p>
