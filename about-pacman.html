            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man" target="_blank">Pacman</a>
                is a fun game that has been around for almost 4 decades. Created in 1980, the idea behind this
                game is super simple. And that’s maybe the major reason why it is so popular even today, many more
                decades after its inception.
            </p>
            <p>The thing that a lot of people like about action and <strong>arcade games</strong> is that they
                are always fun and they bring in a new perspective on the way you play.</p>

            <h2>How to play Pacman?</h2>
            <p>With Pacman you really get all of that. The idea here is that you are the hero in a maze and you have
                to eliminate all the enemies as fast as possible.
                You must do that as quickly as you can, otherwise you will lose the game and you definitely want to
                avoid such a thing as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing to keep in mind about <strong>Pacman</strong> is that you have to collect all the bubbles on
                the game board in order to complete the game.</p>

            <p>And while you do that you also need to figure out a way to avoid all those ghosts that are coming to get
                you.
                The ability to <strong>play Pacman</strong> is really exciting because you are free to choose whatever
                route you want.
                And the <strong>Pacman online experience</strong> brings you so many different options all the time.
                You never get to have the same gameplay, even if the game is quite distinct and unique.
                It’s all about being creative and having fun here, which is exactly what you need.</p>

            <h2>Why should you play Pacman online?</h2>
            <p>The first thing you will like is that this is <strong>Pacman unblocked</strong>. There’s no need to
                worry about any limits or anything like that,
                you can instead play this anywhere you want and on whatever device. And it will be more than impressive
                every time. </p>
            <p>Plus, if you play Pacman online you can enjoy the game <strong>free of charge</strong>. And that’s
                maybe the best thing in here.
                It really is something cool and different and it offers you an enticing array of unique benefits for
                you to explore regardless of the situation.</p>

            <h2>Are there any Pacman strategies?</h2>
            <p>When you enter the <strong>Pacman play world</strong>, you really have everything under control.
                You can choose when and how to play and you can just have fun with it.
                The idea here is to understand what you are getting into and actively focus on a fun experience all the
                time.
                The challenge with this game is that every variant is unique, so the strategies can shift.
                But then again that’s what really makes the title so interesting and intense in its own right.</p>
            <p>If you love <strong>arcade games</strong> and you want some old school gaming in your life, check out
                Pacman.
                This is a great title with something new and super rewarding all the time.
                You will be incredibly happy with the way everything works and the outcome can indeed be a cool one no
                matter the situation.
                We encourage you to check out <strong>Pacman online</strong> right now if you want a fun little arcade
                experience in your life!
                
                Anyway it's <strong>Pacman 30th anniversary</strong> and it's worth trying at least!
                </p>
                <p>
                P.S. a few tips for our game.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you don't like sound while playing pacman you can mute it in game settings and play old pacman game without sound!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All game versions are playable on mobile and desktop
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All game versions are in full screen. So you can play pacman and ms pacman on fullscreen mode, even on mobile!

                            </li>
                    </ul>
